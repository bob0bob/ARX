Alternate Reality X - Release 0.82
----------------------------------

Alternate Reality X (ARX for short) is a computer role playing game based on the classic 1980s game series by Philip Price. Whilst many features of the original City and Dungeon games are faithfully reproduced ARX is not intended to be an identical copy and contains some new features and differences in gameplay.

Currently you can explore the City and Dungeon levels, visit many of the special locations, have encounters, buy weapons and find treasure but there is still a lot to be added before it will be close to completion.

I'm also planning to add in the originally planned, unfinished scenarios. These include the Arena, the Palace, The Wilderness, Revelation and Destiny. These are a longer term development goal.

If you like the game and wish to support its further development you can make a donation to cover website costs and my time over at www.crpgdev.com, either through Paypal or Patreon. Any feedback including bug reports, questions or suggestions can be sent to the address below.

I hope you enjoy the game.

All the best,

Video cards
-----------

Please note that ARX requires OpenGL compliant video card drivers. If you find ARX runs slowly or displays white blocks rather than encounter images then it is likely that your computer is using a generic video driver that comes with Windows rather than the video card suppliers driver.

I've also experienced a number of issues with onboard Intel graphics. Let me know if you experience any display issues, stating the type of video card you have and I'll see if I can resolve the problem or provide a workaround in a later release. I've had no problems with NVidia or ATI/AMD graphics cards. These run ARX very smoothly.
