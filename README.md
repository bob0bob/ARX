Alternate Reality X

Since the original coder has not been able to update the code in about a year.  I've stepped in to see this completed.  There are many bug fixes that has needed to be done and enhancements.  That is what I'm trying to do here.

The source code is under src folder.  You can look at it compile it.  

I will be releasing new versions all the time.  I will post that here and on the origianl forum that CRPG created for Alternate Reality X.
