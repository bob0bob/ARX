Alternate Reality X
--------------------

Since the original coder has not been able to update the code in about a year.  I've stepped in to see this completed.  There are many bug fixes that has needed to be done and enhancements.  That is what I'm trying to do here.

The source code is under src folder.  You can look at it compile it.  

I will be releasing new versions all the time.  I will post that here and on the origianl forum that CRPG created for Alternate Reality X.

<B>All</b> releases will be under the folder "Releases". I will zip them up there for downloading.

<br/>
If you wish to compile the code, it is located under "SRC".  it has code:block file and a dev-C++ project file.  Also a makefile for gcc is locate there.  You will need to change the libary file pointers to your setup.  

I've not create a step by step instruction on how to compile the code.

Alternate Reality X 
----------------------------------

Alternate Reality X (ARX for short) is a computer role playing game based on the classic 1980s game series by Philip Price. Whilst many features of the original City and Dungeon games are faithfully reproduced ARX is not intended to be an identical copy and contains some new features and differences in gameplay.

Currently you can explore the City and Dungeon levels, visit many of the special locations, have encounters, buy weapons and find treasure but there is still a lot to be added before it will be close to completion.

I'm also planning to add in the originally planned, unfinished scenarios. These include the Arena, the Palace, The Wilderness, Revelation and Destiny. These are a longer term development goal.

If you like the game and wish to support its further development you can make a donation to cover website costs and my time over at www.crpgdev.com, either through Paypal or Patreon. Any feedback including bug reports, questions or suggestions can be sent to the address below.

I hope you enjoy the game.


Support
---------------------------
If have you any Amiga images from the game that are missing from this version,  please let us know and send them to us, so we can get them into the ARX system.  Many of the Amiga graphics are being used for the 16bit version if you play using 16bit vs. 8bit.  Most of the 8bit is from Atari.

Just create an Issue and attach the graphics to it.  It can just be a screen shot and we can get it into the system.

Thanks for all your support.
